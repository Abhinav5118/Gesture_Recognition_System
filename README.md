# Gesture_Recognition_System
This Python script utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow to detect hand gestures through a webcam feed. It loads a pre-trained model for gesture recognition and draws landmarks on detected hands. It then predicts the gesture based on the landmarks and displays the corresponding class name on the video feed.
